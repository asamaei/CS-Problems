# CCPS 109 Practice Problems

This repository contains my solutions to practice problems for the CCPS 109 course at the University of Ryerson. Each problem has been solved using Python, and the code is organized into separate folders for each assignment.

## Getting Started

To use this code, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the appropriate folder for the assignment you wish to view. Each file contains the code for a single problem, along with comments explaining how the solution works.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions for improving the code or finding more efficient solutions to the problems, please feel free to open a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my coding skills and learn from others.
